What Did i accomplish yesterday?
Yesterday I was working on setting up this meeting minutes webpage. Significantly took a long time due to confusing with upstream.

What did I do today?
I finished the webpage. I completed the lab following all instrutions. Honestly it doesnt look great but I completed all of the requirements.

Any obstacles?
I did run into a couple onstacles like learning how to do grid and flexbox. I managed to do it tho and get it fixed.
